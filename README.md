### Use Instructions
- Download Repository
- Open up XAMPP, start the MySL server
- ***
- Be sure to create a database called student_space and grant all attributes
- to a user named "student" with the password set as "hello." From there
- run the source command to create the catandmouse table from the SQL file.
- The SQL file can be found in the repository, or can be downloaded separately.
- To create the catandmouse table, run the command "source c:\{file_path}\catandmouse.sql"
- ***
- Open up CMD, run bat file for server
-   The bat files can either be ran from the ones located in the bat_files folder
-   which are executed by double-clicking or by right clicking and running.
-   If you choose to run the bat file from the command line, make sure your download
-   is located in the package folder for CatAndMouse without the cd command being used.
-   Whichever way you choose, make sure your file path is configured.
- The server can be ran automatically as the code is. To make sure the Player can
- connect to the server change the host found in PlayerGUI in the constructor method
- from "localhost" to the ipconfig address of the server.
- Open up second CMD, run bat file for client
- Open Up third CMD, run bat file for client again
- ***
- Create an Account (if no login credentials already obtained) for each client
-   A set of universal login credentials can be found in the SQL file that creates
-   the catandmouse table.
- Return back to title screen
- Log in using the correct credentials for each player client
- If you wish to see a list of all logged on players, click refresh on the GameRoom Screen
- If you are ready to play, click play game on both clients.
- If you wish to log out, you may do so
- The server will wait for each player to click play game before the gamescreen is launched
- Once the game screen is opened for both clients, the mouse's objective is to avoid the cat by using the arrow keys to "run" away
- The cat's objective is to catch the mouse by making contact with the mouse
- The cat only has 30 seconds to do so, or the mouse will win
- Once the game is over, each user may click the play again button.
- If both player clients wish to do so, they may both click Play Game again in the game room screen, following the same procedure as before
- Once the player is finished playing, they may log out of the game using the log out button
